# BlueJayson

BlueJayson is a simple Pythonic data definition library to manage very basic data validations and serializations to and from JSON.

**This project is still in development and is not yet production-ready.**

## Why another library?

Other similar libraries simply do not fit my use cases. So I write another one.  
It's also my opportunity to practice meta-programming in Python (which is very cool by the way).
